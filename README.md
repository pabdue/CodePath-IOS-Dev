### My App Idea: Tuned-In
I would like to develop a music-sharing app that's like Instagram but for Spotify song snippets. Share short music clips, create playlists, and discover new tracks. Collaborate on playlists with friends, explore what's trending, and interact with in a community that is passionate about music. Tuned-In brings music to social networking.

## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app
- Being new to IOS Developement, I have never used Xcode nor coded in Swift. It took me time and research to find the different features in Xcode. Swift programming wasn't too difficult as it is similar to other programming languages, but it is still very new to me.
